# Problem_Solving_Using_C
The repository consists of C programs from the C Programming Laboratory of VTU with subject code 18CPL17.

## Contents


### 1. Simple Calculator Simulation
Develop a program to solve simple computational problems using arithmetic expressions and the use of each operator, leading to the simulation of a commercial calculator. (No built-in math function)

### 2. Quadratic Equation Roots
Develop a program to compute the roots of a quadratic equation by accepting the coefficients. Print appropriate messages.

### 3. Palindrome Check for Positive Integer
Develop a program to find the reverse of a positive integer and check if it is a palindrome or not. Display appropriate messages.

### 4. Electricity Bill Calculation
An electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity:
- For the first 200 units, 80 paise per unit.
- For the next 100 units, 90 paise per unit.
- Beyond 300 units, Rs 1 per unit.
All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 100 as a meter charge. If the total amount is more than Rs 400, then an additional surcharge of 15% of the total amount is charged. Write a program to read the name of the user and the number of units consumed, and print out the charges.

### 5. Binary Search with 1D Arrays
Introduce 1D Array manipulation and implement Binary search.

### 6. Prime Number Checker
Implement a program using functions to check whether the given number is prime and display appropriate messages. (No built-in math function)

### 7. Matrix Multiplication with 2D Arrays
Develop a program to introduce 2D Array manipulation and implement Matrix multiplication while ensuring the rules of multiplication are checked.

### 8. Sin(x) Taylor Series Approximation
Develop a Program to compute Sin(x) using Taylor series approximation. Compare your result with the built-in Library function. Print both the results with appropriate messages.

### 9. String Operations
Write functions to implement string operations such as compare, concatenate, and string length. Convince the parameter passing techniques.

### 10. Bubble Sort
Develop a program to sort the given set of N numbers using Bubble sort.

### 11. Square Root Calculation
Develop a program to find the square root of a given number N and execute it for all possible inputs with appropriate messages. Note: Donâ€™t use the library function sqrt(n).

### 12. Student Information with Structures
Implement structures to read, write, compute average marks, and find students scoring above and below the average marks for a class of N students.

### 13. Statistics with Pointers
Develop a program using pointers to compute the sum, mean, and standard deviation of all elements stored in an array of n real numbers.

### 14. Binary to Decimal Conversion (Recursive)
Implement Recursive functions for Binary to Decimal Conversion.
